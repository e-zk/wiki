<h1 id="Laptop%20setup">Laptop setup</h1>

<p>Model: Lenovo X1 Carbon (5th generation)<br/>
OS: Dualboot Windows&#47;OpenBSD</p>

<h2 id="Windows">Windows</h2>

<p>I&#39;m using Windows mostly for when I need to use something like MS Office for a Uni class.<br/>
It&#39;s multimedia performance is also better than OpenBSD&#39;s, so I use it for video calls and voice chats, as well as watching videos (though, 9&#47;10 when I watch something it is on my smartphone).</p>

<p>Notable programs+applications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows Terminal + WSL2<br/>
Where most of my development and writing goes on.</li>
<li>Firefox ESR<br/>
Main browser. I use Sideberry, and Multi-Account Containers. Also can&#39;t forget uBlock Origin.</li>
<li>Firefox Nightly<br/>
For testing, and when I&#39;m curious about the upcoming FF features.</li>
<li>Chrome Dev<br/>
Testing stuff, using websites that don&#39;t work in Firefox.</li>
<li>Android Studio<br/>
For the random Android development I sometimes attempt.</li>
<li>Mark Text<br/>
Best open source Markdown editor for Windows in my opinion.</li>
<li>WinSCP<br/>
My preferred (S)FTP and file transfer client.</li>
<li>Windows PowerTools<br/>
Tools for power users. Enough said.</li>
</ul>

<p>I make frequent use of Windows Sandbox. I sandbox applications that I&#39;d rather not be running. For instance, Zoom, and Discord. Windows Sandbox allows audio+microphone passthrough, and it works great. I have had mixed results with video&#47;webcam passthrough though. It seems to have stopped working recently.</p>

<h2 id="OpenBSD">OpenBSD</h2>

<p>I was drawn to OpenBSD because of it&#39;s good track record for security. However, I do think that is oversold.
OpenBSD&#39;s approach to security is well.. different to any other OS.<br/>
What I&#39;m getting at is that I am aware OpenBSD has security shortcomings, and that their approach to security can be considered odd at times. I use OpenBSD more for the excellent documentation, the simple, readable code, than for the security features.</p>

<p>I use Full-disk encryption via bioctl(8). Supposedly similar to Linux&#39;s DM-Crypt with LUKS, which is nice.</p>

<p>Notable programs+applications:</p>

<ul>
<li>cwm<br/>
Floating Window manager.</li>
<li>uRXVT<br/>
Main terminal emulator. I almost prefer xterm but something drew me to urxvt (I don&#39;t recall what).</li>
<li>Firefox ESR<br/>
Main browser. Sideberry, Multi-Account containers, etc. Also I make use of different Firefox profiles for different stuff - far easier to script and integrate with on a Unix-like OS than Windows IMO.</li>
<li>Chromium<br/>
For testing. I also use it with <code>--app=</code> all the time.</li>
</ul>
