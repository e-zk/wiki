<h2 id="Work%20profile">Work profile</h2>

<p>I use <em>Shelter</em> to &#8220;isolate&#8221; my other apps somewhat. Shelter creates a &#8220;Work Profile&#8221;. Work profiles are a built-in Android feature that allow you to have a separate profile for work-related apps. This is usually managed by your work organisation but Shelter makes one and &#8220;manages&#8221; it for you. The work profile can be turned off - disabling all the work profile apps with it.<br/>
The benefit of a work profile is that it is more accessible than traditional Android user accounts. However, to my knowledge it coexists on the Owner profile - so the encryption keys for the data are the same. This is where a separate user account would come in handy - the seperate user account&#8217;s data is encrypted with a different key.</p>

<p>Work profile apps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aurora Store<br/>
For downloading apps from the Play Store without Play Services.</li>
<li>Bromite<br/>
Browser (used mostly for Uni-related work).</li>
<li>MS Teams<br/>
For Uni classes that have a MS Teams rooom</li>
<li>$GENERIC_ROSTER_APP<br/>
For checking my $WORK roster.</li>
<li>$EMAIL_APP<br/>
For emails emails.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="COVID-19">COVID-19</h2>

<p>With the rise of the Coronavirus it&#8217;s become essential to &#8220;check-in&#8221; to places. I have put this off for so long, but with an increase in cases of the Delta variant in my neighbourhood I think it&#8217;s wise for me to be checking into places if I do ever leave the house.<br/>
In my opinion, check-in <em>apps</em> should not be a requirement to check in somewhere. Please, just let me check-in online, via a webpage (remember those?). I don&#8217;t want to install some crappy software written by a technologically-inept and privacy ignorant government on my phone.</p>

<p>So, I install my check-in app in a dedicated user profile. No other apps are installed to this profile. When I need to check-in somewhere:</p>

<ol>
<li>Switch to the &#8220;COVID19&#8221; user account from the phone lockscreen</li>
<li>Open the check-in app</li>
<li>Grant temporary camera access to the app</li>
<li>Scan the barcode</li>
<li>Switch back to Owner profile</li>
</ol>

<p>When the profile is closed all the apps within it are stopped. This ensures the app isn&#8217;t running in the background. </p>
